# Tensorflow action recognition
All operation is based KTH dataset, including Alexnet, Vgg16, LSTM, CNN-LSTM.

1. Data reading: allreading, batch reading, tfrecord reding, list reading, tfrecord test
2. Data preprocess: shuffle, resize, crop, standardization
3. Model save and restore to test
4. Tensorboard: loss, accuracy, feturemap show
5. Conv and fc layer feature extractor then sabved mat file
6. Dropout out, batch normalization, optimizer select, learning rate select
7. Finetune base imagenent pretrained parmaeter
8. Model convert to pb
9. Extracted feature classfiy with SVM
